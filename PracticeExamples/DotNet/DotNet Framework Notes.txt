.NET FRAMEWORKS

.NET Framework: a platform to build upon
-- Any language can be used to develop on the .NET Framework
-- Common Intermediate Language (CIL): Transpiles code into an 'intermediate language' for the .NET Framework
-- Just In Time compiler (JIT): Compiles CIL code to machine code for the CLR.
-- Common Language Runtime (CLR): Executes x86 machine code.

.NET Core: ver 3.1, same as 'Framework' but streamlined for modern machines and languages by removing legacy support
-- Much faster than 'Framework'
-- Requires minor changes to code

.NET: 'Core' ver 5 and later and same as 'Core'.
-- Just a later version of 'Core'

.NET Standard: All compatibility to .NET types
- Includes compatibility for third party libraries like Unity and Xamerin

.NET ver 6: Consolidation of all versions and compatibilites for everything
- Less boilerplate such as namespaces
