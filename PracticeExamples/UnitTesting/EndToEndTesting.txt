END-TO-END TEST -- Drives an application through its UI (peak of the 'test pyramid')
- Example: A client logging into a website and interacting with with whatever needs to be tested
-- 'Selenium' is an end-to-end testing tool that records user interaction and plays it back for end-to-end testing
- Provides the highest confidence
- Very slow
- Fragile since changes to the application breaks the test
