FUNDIMENTALS OF UNIT TESTING
- Tests are as importamt as production code, so it must be clean, maintainable, and as simple as possible (single responsibility)
- Should not contain any logic (no loops, conditionals, etc)
- Each test should be isolated from eachother
- Not too specific or too general

- Unit tests accompany the production project as a separate project, named with dot notation and 'UnitTests' -- Ex: 'ProjectName.UnitTests'
-- Each test class of the unit test project mirrors each class of the production project -- Ex: 'ProjectName.ClassName' means the unit test will mirror as 'ProjectName.UnitTest.ClassNameTests'
- Test method naming: 'MethodUnderTest_ScenaioToBeTested_TheExpectedBehavior'
