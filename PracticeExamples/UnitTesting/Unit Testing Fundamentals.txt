FUNDAMENTALS OF UNIT TESTING
- Tests are as important as production code, so it must be clean, maintainable, and as simple as possible
- Should not contain any logic (no loops, conditionals, etc)
- Each test should be isolated from eachother (single responsibility)
- Not too specific or too general
- Unit tests accompany the production project as a separate project, named with dot notation as 'UnitTests' -- Ex: 'ProjectName.UnitTests'
-- Each test class of the unit test project mirrors each class of the production project -- Ex: 'ProjectName.ClassName' means the unit test will mirror as 'ProjectName.UnitTest.ClassNameTests'
- Test method naming: 'MethodUnderTest_ScenaioToBeTested_TheExpectedBehavior'

TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD) - Writing unit tests first and then production code that fulfills those tests
- Produces more trustworthy results
- Makes the process more complicated


--- TYPES OF TESTS ---

UNIT TEST -- Tests a unit of an application without its external dependencies; tests a 'unit of work' (base of the 'test pyramid')
- Tests a class or multiple classes WITHOUT their external dependencies
- Example: A test which executes the logic of a class to read a database, but local data is instead used in place of a database
- Simple to write
- Quick execution
- May provide inaccurate tests without including dependancies

INTEGRATION TEST -- Tests the application with its external dependencies (center of the 'test pyramid')
- Tests a class or multiple classes WITH their external dependencies
- Example: A test which executes the logic of a class to read a database, and that database is called during the test
- Longer to execute
- Provides more confidence

END-TO-END TEST -- Drives an application through its UI (peak of the 'test pyramid')
- Example: A client logging into a website and interacting with with whatever needs to be tested
-- 'Selenium' is an end-to-end testing tool that records user interaction and plays it back for end-to-end testing
- Provides the highest confidence
- Very slow
- Fragile since changes to the application breaks the test
