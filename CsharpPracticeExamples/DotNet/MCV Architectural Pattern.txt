MVC - "Model View Controller" Architectural Pattern

MODEL - Application data and behavior in terms of its problem domain, and independant of the UI
-- Models represent the application state and rules, also known as 'POCOs' or "Plain Old CLR Objects"
--- In a video rental environment, model class examples would be: 'Movies', 'Customers', "Rentals', 'Transactions'

VIEW - The 'presentation layer'
-- HTML that is displayed to the client

CONTROLLER - Handles HTTP requests
-- A controller is selected which gets the models and provides the view for the client

ROUTER - Not part of MVC, but is always used to handle requests
-- Initiates request to the proper controller
-- Example: when '/movies' endpoint of 'videos.com' is called, the 'MoviesController' class or method is initiated
